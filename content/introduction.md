## Introduction:

Loan lending is an essential business activity for banks and loan default often occurs when a borrower takes money from the bank and does not repay back the loan on time. SuperLender, a local lending company, could suffer from revenue damage if it has incorrect predictions about its clients.

In the visual analysis course, we have learned several software packages to conduct visual data analysis, and the Shiny APP can display various graphs on the dashboard to realize the interactive function with the audience. The Nigeria Bank’s loan default prediction challenge is a data science problem from ZINDI Competition. By answering this question, this group project aims to create a flexible data interaction platform to predict the potential loan default risks for SuperLender’s potential clients.

### Our Shiny includes:

#### Loan Defaulters Description/ 1st Part

In first part of shiny app, we will  give you the description of the customers historical recording, including the loan amount,  education situation and employment pattern.

#### Correlation Exploration/ 2rd Part

The second part will explore the correlation between different factors to see if there are linear or non-linear correlation, as well as the strength and direction of the relationship.

#### Prediction Model/ 3nd part

In last part, we built up prediction model to forecast the loan repayment results based on different input information.
